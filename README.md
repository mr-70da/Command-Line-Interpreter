# Command Line Interpreter (CLI)

This project is a basic Command Line Interpreter (CLI) inspired by Unix/Linux shells. The CLI allows users to execute common system commands and includes internal commands for additional functionality.

## Features

### 1. Command Execution
The CLI supports executing standard system commands, enabling users to interact with the file system and manage files. Supported commands include:
- **`pwd`**: Prints the current working directory.
- **`cd <directory>`**: Changes the current directory to the specified path.
- **`ls`**: Lists files in the current directory.
  - **`ls -a`**: Lists all files, including hidden files.
  - **`ls -r`**: Lists files in reverse order.
- **`mkdir <directory>`**: Creates a new directory.
- **`rmdir <directory>`**: Removes an empty directory.
- **`touch <file>`**: Creates a new file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
- **`mv <source> <destination>`**: Moves or renames files and directories.
- **`rm <file>`**: Removes a specified file.
- **`cat <file>`**: Displays the content of a specified file.
- **Redirection and Pipes**:
  - **`>`**: Redirects output to a file, creating it if it doesn't exist.
  - **`>>`**: Appends output to an existing file.
  - **`|`**: Pipes output from one command to another (if applicable).

### 2. Internal Commands
The CLI also includes internal commands:
- **`exit`**: Terminates the CLI session.
- **`help`**: Displays a list of available commands and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cli-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cli-project
   ```
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java SimpleCLI
   ```

## Usage
1. After running `SimpleCLI`, you’ll be presented with a command prompt.
2. Enter any of the supported commands listed above to interact with the CLI.
3. Use `help` for a list of available commands.
4. Use `exit` to close the CLI session.

## Examples
- **To print the current directory**:
  ```shell
  pwd
  ```
- **To create a new directory named `test`**:
  ```shell
  mkdir test
  ```
- **To display contents of a file named `example.txt`**:
  ```shell
  cat example.txt
  ```
- **To redirect the output of `ls` to a file**:
  ```shell
  ls > output.txt
  ```
